# Swiss Heavy Metals in Soil Dashboard

A comprehensive Streamlit dashboard for analyzing heavy metal concentrations in Swiss soils across different municipalities, land uses, and time periods.

Data from [visualize.admin.ch](https://visualize.admin.ch/en/browse?previous=%7B%22order%22%3A%22SCORE%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22heavy+metal%22%7D&dataset=https%3A%2F%2Fenvironment.ld.admin.ch%2Ffoen%2Fubd006601%2F5&dataSource=Prod).

## Features

### üìä Overview Dashboard
- **Top 5 Municipalities Grid**: Small multiple bar charts showing municipalities with highest concentrations for each heavy metal
- **Time Series Comparison**: Line charts comparing municipality trends vs national averages over time
- **Land Use Breakdown**: Stacked bar charts showing how land use affects heavy metal concentrations

### üèòÔ∏è Municipality Detail
- **Municipality Time Series**: Evolution of heavy metals over time for selected municipalities
- **Comparison to National Mean**: How selected municipalities compare to Swiss national trends
- **Land Use Profile**: Heavy metal distribution across different land uses within municipalities

### üß™ Heavy Metal Detail
- **Municipality Ranking**: Top municipalities with highest concentrations for a specific heavy metal
- **Time Evolution**: Multi-line chart showing how the heavy metal changed across municipalities
- **Land Use Comparison**: Box plots showing distribution across land use types

## üó∫Ô∏è Map View
- **Interactive Switzerland Map**: Folium-powered map centered on Switzerland showing municipality locations
- **Color-Coded Markers**: Circle markers with color intensity representing heavy metal concentration levels (green=low, orange=medium, red=high)
- **Size-Responsive Markers**: Marker size scales with concentration levels for visual emphasis
- **Quantile-Based Legend**: Color coding based on percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) for relative comparison
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Click markers to see detailed information including concentration, year, and land use
- **Summary Statistics**: Quick metrics showing municipality count, average/max/min concentrations
- **Geographic Insights**: Side-by-side comparison of municipalities with highest and lowest concentrations
- **Municipality Details**: Detailed data table for clicked municipalities showing sampling history
